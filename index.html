  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <dl id="faq">
    <dt>Don't I need a development enviroment to work with JavaScript?</dt>
    <dd>Nope. As with HTML, all you need is a text editor and a browser that supports JavaScript.You might be confusing JavaScript with Java, a more comprehensive programming language that needs at least a compiler for its programs to run. However, tools like FireBug for Firefox, the Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar, and Safari's Web Inspector can make your life easier. Consult the documetation on those tools to learn more about their JavaScript features. </dd>
    <dt>What is AJAXS?</dt>
    <dd>One topic we haven't converd yet is AJAXS. AJAXS is a term used to describe scripts that communicate with the server without requiring a Web page to be fully reloaded. For example, you can use it to fetch information and display it on the page, or to submit a form for processing, all without changing the full page in the browser. I'll discuss AJAXS in detail in Lesson 16, "Using JavaScript Libraries."</dd>
    <dt>When I use JavaScript, do I need to accommodate users whose browsers may not support JavaScript or who have disabled it?</dt>
    <dd>Some estimates indicate that over 90% of Web users have JavaScript enabled. However, unless you have a really good reason not to, you should make accommodations for users without JavaScript. You need not offer users who don't have JavaScript an identical experience to those who have it, but they should be able to access your site. For example, if you run an online store, do you really want to shut out users because of their browser configuration?</dd>
